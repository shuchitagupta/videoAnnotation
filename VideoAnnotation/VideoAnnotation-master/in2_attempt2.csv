6952;4;0;0.1;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; too quick down the leg side, Dhawan gets a tickle fine
6953;4;0;0.2;Bond;Dhawan;no run; better line, around off, hit one bounce to cover
6969;4;0;0.3;Bond;Dhawan;no run; short, angling away, Babu [Dhawan] looks to cut, gets a bottom edge through to Saha
7051;8;0;0.4;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; lovely shot, poor bowling! full and wide, Dhawan gets across, on a knee, and elegantly extra-cover-drives it
7072;8;0;0.5;Bond;Dhawan;no run; tucks him up with a short delivery, played towards square leg
7121;12;0;0.6;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; another nice shot, there is not much room on the cut shot, but he hits it powerfully into the ground, and it then bounces over the ring of cover fielders
7155;12;0;1.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; wide outside off, Tendulkar shoulders arms
7235;16;0;1.2;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; what a shot! half-volley on middle stump, and he just meets it, and the on-drive goes flying across the outfield
7236;16;0;1.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; shorter outside off, and he lets it go through
7237;16;0;1.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; drives in front of his body, straight to mid-off
7359;20;0;1.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; what an outfield this is, he mis-hits a drive outside off, but it goes fast across the turf, beats mid-off and goes for four
7420;24;0;1.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; lovely shot again, this time he hits the drive well, opening the face on it, and placing it between mid-off and extra cover - all runs so far have cone in six boundaries
7454;24;0;2.1;Gayle;Dhawan;no run; short, around off, hit to point
7570;25;0;2.2;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; slightly back of  a length, punched down to long-off for a single
7641;26;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 wide; fired full and wide down the leg side, Tendulkar misses the vertical sweep, which would have got four
7656;27;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 wide; fired even further down the leg side
7673;28;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; flighted around off, pushed down to long-on
7696;29;0;2.4;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; short of a length, and punched down to long-off for a single
7722;31;0;2.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;2 runs; full ball, driven with an open face, Mathews at cover gets a bad bounce off a practice wicket and gives away an extra run
7723;31;0;2.6;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; what a save by Mathews, he has saved four here, was a crunchy extra-cover drive but Mathews dived to his right from cover - full-length - and doesn't even give away a single, so quick is he to get the ball back
7724;31;0;3.1;Sharma;Dhawan;no run; back of a length, no room, defended to cover
7868;32;0;3.2;Sharma;Dhawan;1 run; driven straight to Harpreet at cover and comes through for one
7912;36;0;3.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; bad bounce surely, Mathews is getting all of it! Punched off the back foot, two cover fielders, Karthik and Mathews have it covered, but it hits the edge of the practice wicket inside the circle, and spins away - going by the form Tendulkar has been over the last two years, he might even have intended it thus
7981;40;0;3.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; poor bowling, tries the bouncer, but there is no sting it, Tendulkar gets inside the line and pulls it over short fine
8002;44;0;3.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; Ishant is being taken to school here, bowls another bouncer at Tendulkar - at his pace, seriously? - and Tendulkar pulls it over midwicket, what a crunchy shot
8069;45;0;3.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 wide; slower ball, wide down the leg side
8070;45;0;3.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; hit to point, and Tendulkar decides against the single, both originally and also off the overthrow
8172;46;0;4.1;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; swept from way outside off, gets a single to deep midwicket
8249;50;0;4.2;Gayle;Tendulkar;FOUR; whipped away from the middle stump, all along the ground, and between midwicket and square leg - and it's a small gap, picked to perfection - fifty up in 4.2
8250;50;0;4.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; and again, this time he finds midwicket, though
8252;50;0;4.4;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; makes room for the cut, but gets a bottom edge on the shot
8301;51;0;4.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; full, driven down to long-on for a single
8302;51;0;4.6;Gayle;Dhawan;no run; punched to extra-cover, no run
8438;52;0;5.1;Bond;Tendulkar;1 run; starts off with a slower ball, around off, takes a single to cover
8439;52;0;5.2;Bond;Dhawan;no run; full ball, slightly swinging in to Dhawan, defended back to him
8440;52;0;5.3;Bond;Dhawan;no run; full ball, pushed to point
8441;52;0;5.4;Bond;Dhawan;no run; nice crunchy cover-drive, can't beat extra cover
8610;56;0;5.5;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; poor short delivery, 125ks, sitting up and asking to be hit, and Dhawan sends it packing to deep midwicket
8624;57;0;5.6;Bond;Dhawan;1 run; this is the quicker short delivery, which means the pull shot travels much squarer, and he gets a single
8721;58;0;6.1;Kartik;Dhawan;1 run; spinning into the pads, turned around the corner for a single
8765;59;0;6.2;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; works the ball into the leg side, from in front of off, and gets a single
8798;60;0;6.3;Kartik;Dhawan;1 run; flat into the pads, helped away for one
8825;61;0;6.4;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; again worked away from in front of the stumps, gets a single to fine leg
8826;61;0;6.5;Kartik;Dhawan;OUT; that's a wicket against the run of the play, Dhawan jumps down the track, looking to chip him over short midwicket, but doesn't get enough elevation and Ganguly takes a sharp overhead catch
8827;61;0;6.6;Kartik;Tiwary;no run; beats him with the turn first up, belts out an appeal, the ball is clearly turning too far down
8828;61;0;7.1;Mathews;Tendulkar;no run; slower bouncer, Tendulkar lets it go, looks at both the umpires, doesn't get the wide call
9091;65;1;7.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;FOUR; what a superb shot, slower bouncer again, and he waits for it and pulls, keeping it down, and places it perfectly between fine leg and deep square
9105;66;1;7.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 wide; and he follows it with a quicker delivery angling down the leg side
9140;67;1;7.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; flicked away from in front of stumps, gets a single to fine leg
9169;67;1;7.4;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; punched with an open face, can't beat point
9170;67;1;7.5;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; back of a length, no room there, hit back to the bowler
9245;69;1;7.6;Mathews;Tiwary;2 runs; short and wide, and crashed away wide of sweeper-cover for two
9306;70;1;8.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; worked away from off stump line, into the leg side for a single
9307;70;1;8.2;Kartik;Tiwary;no run; nice forward-defensive outside off
9378;71;1;8.3;Kartik;Tiwary;1 run; full into the pads, driven down to long-on for one
9379;71;1;8.4;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; slows this down, bowls way outside off so Sachin can flick him to leg, gets a defensive shot out of him
9380;71;1;8.5;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; and smartly bowled again, flatter outside off, and gets a leading-edge from him, but doesn't pick the ball at all, and doesn't accept the return catch
9381;71;1;8.6;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; flighted outside off again, and driven straight to point
9391;71;1;9.1;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; slower ball, around leg, and breaking away, hit back to the bowler
9675;72;1;9.2;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; slower again, punched down to long-on for one
9719;73;1;9.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; pushes a length ball down to long-on for a single
9770;75;1;9.4;Mathews;Tiwary;2 runs; Tiwary muscles a short slow ball down the ground, Karthik from long-on has to put in the dive to save two runs
9771;75;1;9.5;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; makes room and hits a length ball back to Mathews, who does well to get a hand to it
9845;76;1;9.6;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; full ball across him, nearly a yorker, gets enough on it to take a quick single
9915;77;1;10.1;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; flat delivery, hit down to long-off for a single
9948;78;1;10.2;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; into the pads, worked away for one to deep square leg
9971;79;1;10.3;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; flat, angled into him, punched wide of long-off
10000;80;1;10.4;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; steps down, drives inside out, can't get it wide enough of long-off for a two
10016;80;1;10.5;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; makes room, Gayle follows him, can't get the drive past extra cover
10017;80;1;10.6;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; steps down, yorks himself, another tight over for KKR
10116;82;1;11.1;Mathews;Tendulkar;2 runs; full ball, placed nicely to the left of long-off, and comes back for two
10155;83;1;11.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; and he looks to slog, a slower delivery it is, and bounces in front of Ganguly at midwicket, who misfields and lets through a single
10206;84;1;11.3;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; nice bouncer, gets high on him, but Tiwary stands tall and manages to keep the pull shot down
10253;85;1;11.4;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; slower ball again, and dragged from off towards deep midwicket for a single
10295;91;1;11.5;Mathews;Tiwary;SIX; he has agricultured this length ball down the ground for a six, gets it high on the bat but there is enough muscle behind it to carry it over long-on
10384;92;1;11.6;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; walks down the track and guides a full delivery past cover for one
10455;96;1;12.1;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; good placement there, Gayle bowls a fast full toss, and he drives it past extra cover - KKR never used their full tosses, remember?
10456;96;1;12.2;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; full outside leg, hits it straight to midwicket
10494;100;1;12.3;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; another full toss and hit down the ground, Mandeep from long-off makes a despairing dive for the catch but it's too far and too fast
10528;101;1;12.4;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; full ball hit to long-off for one
10590;102;1;12.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; worked off the hips for a single to square leg
10619;106;1;12.6;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; and Tiwary is at it again, length ball, and he muscles it down the ground, and damn straight, four more, we are headed towards a quick finish
10723;110;1;13.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; Nothing has changed here son! When he was taken off the attack, Tendulkar was hitting Ishant for fours. He comes back, bowls first ball on a length, and Tendulkar lofts him over midwicket
10783;114;1;13.2;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; length again, and he has been smashed past midwicket again! Tough love from the senior man of his international side
10811;116;1;13.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;2 runs; gets the yorker in, and he gets into the gap on the on side and keeps the strike again
10812;116;1;13.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; slower legcutter, Tendulkar looks to guide it past the keeper but is beaten
10908;117;1;13.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 run; full ball outside off, and he flicks it to on, he is just toying with Ishant
10909;117;1;13.6;Sharma;Tiwary;OUT; Ganguly takes a second good catch off the night! Tiwary is looking extra cover but it is too short for the shot, and he ends up seemingly lobbing it over Dada at short extra, but he times the jump to perfection and pulls off a one-handed stunner
11082;119;2;14.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;2 runs; flighted outside off, looks to play to on, gets a leading edge but it travels so slowly to long-on that he can come back for two
11109;120;2;14.2;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; pushes one to long-on for a single
11110;120;2;14.3;Kartik;Pollard;no run; flat ball, Pollard looks to cut but it is too full
11111;120;2;14.4;Kartik;Pollard;no run; gets the big front foot down and defends
11182;121;2;14.5;Kartik;Pollard;1 run; teases Karthik, this is flighted, he stays back, and gets the bat down just when Karthik is thinking of an lbw appeal
11210;122;2;14.6;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; flat delivery on off, worked away for one to long-on
11288;123;2;15.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 run; gets this one right into the block hole, just a single to long-on
11291;123;2;15.2;Sharma;Pollard;no run; gets the yorker right again, and Pollard hits it back to him
11394;125;2;15.3;Sharma;Pollard;2 runs; nicely bowled, slower ball, not easy to pick, Pollard adjusts well, keeps the pull down, and finds a gap to be able to come back for two
11435;129;2;15.4;Sharma;Pollard;FOUR; who says Pollard can't be delicate, he has guided this length delivery expertly between short third man and backward point
11436;129;2;15.5;Sharma;Pollard;OUT; and Pollard has followed up a nice shot with a daft one, plays all across the line of a length delivery, Ishant is full and straight at the right time, and collects a plumb lbw verdict
11457;129;2;15.6;Sharma;Sathish;no run; and Ishant bowls a bouncer right away, Sathish slam-ducks it, almost Sampras like, but two-handed - awkward shot, but he is safe as he has hit it into the ground
11763;130;3;16.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; and he gets another leading edge out of Tendulkar who is bent at playing him to on, but again the edge is safe and he gets a single to point
11800;131;3;16.2;Kartik;Sathish;1 run;
11812;132;3;16.3;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; flat into the pads, easily worked away for one
11828;136;3;16.4;Kartik;Sathish;FOUR; oh it's a tough shot made to look easy, makes room early, gives Karthik three stumps to aim at, and he bowls flat and Sathish meets it with an open face and places it between short third and backward point
11864;138;3;16.5;Kartik;Sathish;2 runs; nice chip shot over extra cover, only looking to clear infield and does that
11884;139;3;16.6;Kartik;Sathish;1 run; opens the face again, and gets just a single this time, but quick running from SRT
11970;143;3;17.1;Bond;Sathish;FOUR; starts off with a slower ball, Sathish stays back and almost as if he is expecting it, he waits for it to arrive and lofts it over cover
12023;147;3;17.2;Bond;Sathish;FOUR; and Sathish gets another boundary, not where he intended this one, though. Looks to whip it over leg, gets a leading edge over point and into the gap
12043;148;3;17.3;Bond;Sathish;1 run; clears the front leg and pulls this one for one
12076;150;3;17.4;Bond;Tendulkar;2 runs; slower ball, and steered to wide of third man for two
12110;151;3;17.5;Bond;Tendulkar;1 run; dabbed to third man for one
12150;152;3;17.6;Bond;Sathish;1 run; slapped to mid-on, comes though for one and makes it despite a direct-hit from Karthik
12271;153;3;18.1;Mathews;Sathish;1 run; yorker, hit to sweeper-cover for one
12319;154;3;18.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; full on the pads, hit straight to short fine
12364;156;3;18.3;Mathews;Sathish;2 runs; and he has ended the match with his second vertical-bat pull, fine of fine leg this time

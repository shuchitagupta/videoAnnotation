728;6;0;0.5;Malinga;Gayle;no run; another slower ball, this time Gayle is with it, and shoulders arms
819;10;0;0.6;Malinga;Gayle;4 byes; Tare should have done better than that! Another slower ball, really slow, 107ks, and Gayle is beaten again. By now Tare should have known what to expect and stayed low, but he didn't, and let go four byes
903;11;0;1.1;Khan;Ganguly;1 run; and nearly again! inside edge, almost through that gap, shaping in towards the off stick late, and somehow Dada gets an inside edge

1254;15;0;2.2;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; oh McLaren goes by what he must heard all this while, bowl short into Ganguly's ribs, and Ganguly somehow gets glove on that awkward pull shot
1299;19;0;2.3;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; much better, what a reply from Dada! moves across the stumps, takes a back-of-a-length delivery and whips it fine, beating long leg
1334;23;0;2.4;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; vintage Ganguly! McLaren's plan has been hit for a six! Bowls short and wide, and he has creamed him past point

1357;24;0;2.5;McLaren;Ganguly;no run; plays with an open face, towards point, where Sathish and Pollard are almost an electric fence

1546;29;0;3.2;Khan;Ganguly;FOUR; short, and sharp, and Ganguly pulls awkwardly, and somehow gets it over the infield, and the fast outfield does the rest

2067;35;0;5.2;Bravo;Gayle;no run; Bravo is perhaps the best fielder of his own bowling, Gayle misses a pick-up shot on the pads, Bravo is off to short midwicket in a flash to field and deny them a leg-bye

3244;64;0;9.4;McLaren;Ganguly;1 run; Ganguly pulls, top-edges, and it somehow lands safe, behind short fine and in front of deep square
3277;65;0;9.5;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; low full toss again, and hit down to long-off for one
3309;67;0;9.6;McLaren;Ganguly;2 runs; over-pitched delivery, driven wide of long-off, comes back for two
3384;68;0;10.1;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; full toss outside off, and still a single, mane full tosses hit for singles
3385;68;0;10.2;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;no run; shorter delivery, makes room, can't get it wide of point
3431;69;0;10.3;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;1 run; flighted around off, gets a single to cover

3757;74;1;11.5;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; full toss again, and again all he can do with it is hit it to long-on

4098;85;1;13.2;Bravo;Gayle;FOUR; nicely played, Gayle gets the better of the leg-side yorker this time, stays back, gets inside the line, and turns it past short fine leg - first boundary in 37 balls
4146;86;1;13.3;Bravo;Gayle;1 run; low full toss, gets under it, punches it, but it is just a single to deep midwicket

4526;102;1;14.6;Malinga;Shah;FOUR; that is a top shot, this is a good delivery and it's a boundary manufactured, stays deep in the crease, pre-meditating a yorker, and yorker it is, and moves across to flick it past midwicket
4615;106;1;15.1;Khan;Gayle;FOUR; one-handed pull for four, the short ball stops at him and he pulls one-handed, past short fine leg - his s/r reaches 100 - he has also reached his IPL best
4659;110;1;15.2;Khan;Gayle;FOUR; that's the first time he has taken full toll of a full toss, moves back to a low full toss and crashes it past short fine - that's his fifty too

5522;139;1;17.6;McLaren;Shah;2 runs; yorker down the leg side, and Tare should have really collected this one, two runs given away
5609;140;1;18.1;Malinga;Gayle;1 run; slower ball, Gayle aborts the big shot, gets a single to point
5658;141;1;18.2;Malinga;Shah;1 run; moves across the stumps, stays deep in the crease, anticipating a yorker, Malinga bowls a slower ball, he flicks it to fine leg for one

5955;152;1;19.3;Khan;Mathews;no run; slower bouncer, beats Mathews comprehensively, and finally Tare keeps well despite the break away from him
6080;154;2;19.4;Khan;Mathews;2 runs; full toss again, and again he can't get it away, hits it just wide of long-on
6113;155;2;19.5;Khan;Mathews;1 run; perfect yorker, can get just a single off it
6114;155;2;19.6;Khan;Gayle;OUT; Has he broken the toe? What a lovely yorker, tailing in late, beats Gayle's bat, gets him on the back toe, Gayle is limping for a leg-bye. Umpire Hazare adds insult to injury, giving him lbw when the ball is sliding down. Hazare won't want this to go close - this one leg-bye could be crucial in the end

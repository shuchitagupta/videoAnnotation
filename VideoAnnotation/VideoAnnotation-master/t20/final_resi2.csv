0.1;Bond to Dhawan;FOUR;4; too quick down the leg side, Dhawan gets a tickle fine
0.2;Bond to Dhawan;no run;4; better line, around off, hit one bounce to cover
0.3;Bond to Dhawan;no run;4; short, angling away, Babu [Dhawan] looks to cut, gets a bottom edge through to Saha
0.4;Bond to Dhawan;FOUR;8; lovely shot, poor bowling! full and wide, Dhawan gets across, on a knee, and elegantly extra-cover-drives it
0.5;Bond to Dhawan;no run;8; tucks him up with a short delivery, played towards square leg
0.6;Bond to Dhawan;FOUR;12; another nice shot, there is not much room on the cut shot, but he hits it powerfully into the ground, and it then bounces over the ring of cover fielders
1.1;Sharma to Tendulkar;no run;12; wide outside off, Tendulkar shoulders arms
1.2;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;16; what a shot! half-volley on middle stump, and he just meets it, and the on-drive goes flying across the outfield
1.3;Sharma to Tendulkar;no run;16; shorter outside off, and he lets it go through
1.4;Sharma to Tendulkar;no run;16; drives in front of his body, straight to mid-off
1.5;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;20; what an outfield this is, he mis-hits a drive outside off, but it goes fast across the turf, beats mid-off and goes for four
1.6;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;24; lovely shot again, this time he hits the drive well, opening the face on it, and placing it between mid-off and extra cover - all runs so far have cone in six boundaries
2.1;Gayle to Dhawan;no run;24; short, around off, hit to point
2.2;Gayle to Dhawan;1 run;25; slightly back of  a length, punched down to long-off for a single

2.4;Gayle to Dhawan;1 run;29; short of a length, and punched down to long-off for a single
2.5;Gayle to Tendulkar;2 runs;31; full ball, driven with an open face, Mathews at cover gets a bad bounce off a practice wicket and gives away an extra run
2.6;Gayle to Tendulkar;no run;31; what a save by Mathews, he has saved four here, was a crunchy extra-cover drive but Mathews dived to his right from cover - full-length - and doesn't even give away a single, so quick is he to get the ball back
3.1;Sharma to Dhawan;no run;31; back of a length, no room, defended to cover
3.2;Sharma to Dhawan;1 run;32; driven straight to Harpreet at cover and comes through for one
3.3;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;36; bad bounce surely, Mathews is getting all of it! Punched off the back foot, two cover fielders, Karthik and Mathews have it covered, but it hits the edge of the practice wicket inside the circle, and spins away - going by the form Tendulkar has been over the last two years, he might even have intended it thus
3.4;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;40; poor bowling, tries the bouncer, but there is no sting it, Tendulkar gets inside the line and pulls it over short fine
3.5;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;44; Ishant is being taken to school here, bowls another bouncer at Tendulkar - at his pace, seriously? - and Tendulkar pulls it over midwicket, what a crunchy shot
3.6;Sharma to Tendulkar;1 wide;45; slower ball, wide down the leg side
3.6;Sharma to Tendulkar;no run;45; hit to point, and Tendulkar decides against the single, both originally and also off the overthrow
4.1;Gayle to Dhawan;1 run;46; swept from way outside off, gets a single to deep midwicket
4.2;Gayle to Tendulkar;FOUR;50; whipped away from the middle stump, all along the ground, and between midwicket and square leg - and it's a small gap, picked to perfection - fifty up in 4.2
4.3;Gayle to Tendulkar;no run;50; and again, this time he finds midwicket, though
4.4;Gayle to Tendulkar;no run;50; makes room for the cut, but gets a bottom edge on the shot
4.5;Gayle to Tendulkar;1 run;51; full, driven down to long-on for a single
4.6;Gayle to Dhawan;no run;51; punched to extra-cover, no run
5.1;Bond to Tendulkar;1 run;52; starts off with a slower ball, around off, takes a single to cover
5.2;Bond to Dhawan;no run;52; full ball, slightly swinging in to Dhawan, defended back to him
5.3;Bond to Dhawan;no run;52; full ball, pushed to point
5.4;Bond to Dhawan;no run;52; nice crunchy cover-drive, can't beat extra cover
5.5;Bond to Dhawan;FOUR;56; poor short delivery, 125ks, sitting up and asking to be hit, and Dhawan sends it packing to deep midwicket
5.6;Bond to Dhawan;1 run;57; this is the quicker short delivery, which means the pull shot travels much squarer, and he gets a single
6.1;Kartik to Dhawan;1 run;58; spinning into the pads, turned around the corner for a single
6.2;Kartik to Tendulkar;1 run;59; works the ball into the leg side, from in front of off, and gets a single
6.3;Kartik to Dhawan;1 run;60; flat into the pads, helped away for one
6.4;Kartik to Tendulkar;1 run;61; again worked away from in front of the stumps, gets a single to fine leg
6.5;Kartik to Dhawan;OUT;61; that's a wicket against the run of the play, Dhawan jumps down the track, looking to chip him over short midwicket, but doesn't get enough elevation and Ganguly takes a sharp overhead catch
6.6;Kartik to Tiwary;no run;61; beats him with the turn first up, belts out an appeal, the ball is clearly turning too far down
7.1;Mathews to Tendulkar;no run;61; slower bouncer, Tendulkar lets it go, looks at both the umpires, doesn't get the wide call
7.2;Mathews to Tendulkar;FOUR;65; what a superb shot, slower bouncer again, and he waits for it and pulls, keeping it down, and places it perfectly between fine leg and deep square
7.3;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 wide;66; and he follows it with a quicker delivery angling down the leg side
7.3;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 run;67; flicked away from in front of stumps, gets a single to fine leg
7.4;Mathews to Tiwary;no run;67; punched with an open face, can't beat point

8.2;Kartik to Tiwary;no run;70; nice forward-defensive outside off
8.3;Kartik to Tiwary;1 run;71; full into the pads, driven down to long-on for one
8.4;Kartik to Tendulkar;no run;71; slows this down, bowls way outside off so Sachin can flick him to leg, gets a defensive shot out of him
8.5;Kartik to Tendulkar;no run;71; and smartly bowled again, flatter outside off, and gets a leading-edge from him, but doesn't pick the ball at all, and doesn't accept the return catch
8.6;Kartik to Tendulkar;no run;71; flighted outside off again, and driven straight to point
9.1;Mathews to Tiwary;no run;71; slower ball, around leg, and breaking away, hit back to the bowler
9.2;Mathews to Tiwary;1 run;72; slower again, punched down to long-on for one
9.3;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 run;73; pushes a length ball down to long-on for a single
9.4;Mathews to Tiwary;2 runs;75; Tiwary muscles a short slow ball down the ground, Karthik from long-on has to put in the dive to save two runs
9.5;Mathews to Tiwary;no run;75; makes room and hits a length ball back to Mathews, who does well to get a hand to it
9.6;Mathews to Tiwary;1 run;76; full ball across him, nearly a yorker, gets enough on it to take a quick single
10.1;Gayle to Tiwary;1 run;77; flat delivery, hit down to long-off for a single
10.2;Gayle to Tendulkar;1 run;78; into the pads, worked away for one to deep square leg

10.5;Gayle to Tiwary;no run;80; makes room, Gayle follows him, can't get the drive past extra cover
10.6;Gayle to Tiwary;no run;80; steps down, yorks himself, another tight over for KKR
11.1;Mathews to Tendulkar;2 runs;82; full ball, placed nicely to the left of long-off, and comes back for two
11.2;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 run;83; and he looks to slog, a slower delivery it is, and bounces in front of Ganguly at midwicket, who misfields and lets through a single
11.3;Mathews to Tiwary;1 run;84; nice bouncer, gets high on him, but Tiwary stands tall and manages to keep the pull shot down
11.4;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 run;85; slower ball again, and dragged from off towards deep midwicket for a single
11.5;Mathews to Tiwary;SIX;91; he has agricultured this length ball down the ground for a six, gets it high on the bat but there is enough muscle behind it to carry it over long-on
11.6;Mathews to Tiwary;1 run;92; walks down the track and guides a full delivery past cover for one
12.1;Gayle to Tiwary;FOUR;96; good placement there, Gayle bowls a fast full toss, and he drives it past extra cover - KKR never used their full tosses, remember?
12.2;Gayle to Tiwary;no run;96; full outside leg, hits it straight to midwicket
12.3;Gayle to Tiwary;FOUR;100; another full toss and hit down the ground, Mandeep from long-off makes a despairing dive for the catch but it's too far and too fast
12.4;Gayle to Tiwary;1 run;101; full ball hit to long-off for one
12.5;Gayle to Tendulkar;1 run;102; worked off the hips for a single to square leg
12.6;Gayle to Tiwary;FOUR;106; and Tiwary is at it again, length ball, and he muscles it down the ground, and damn straight, four more, we are headed towards a quick finish
13.1;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;110; Nothing has changed here son! When he was taken off the attack, Tendulkar was hitting Ishant for fours. He comes back, bowls first ball on a length, and Tendulkar lofts him over midwicket
13.2;Sharma to Tendulkar;FOUR;114; length again, and he has been smashed past midwicket again! Tough love from the senior man of his international side
13.3;Sharma to Tendulkar;2 runs;116; gets the yorker in, and he gets into the gap on the on side and keeps the strike again
13.4;Sharma to Tendulkar;no run;116; slower legcutter, Tendulkar looks to guide it past the keeper but is beaten
13.5;Sharma to Tendulkar;1 run;117; full ball outside off, and he flicks it to on, he is just toying with Ishant
13.6;Sharma to Tiwary;OUT;117; Ganguly takes a second good catch off the night! Tiwary is looking extra cover but it is too short for the shot, and he ends up seemingly lobbing it over Dada at short extra, but he times the jump to perfection and pulls off a one-handed stunner
14.1;Kartik to Tendulkar;2 runs;119; flighted outside off, looks to play to on, gets a leading edge but it travels so slowly to long-on that he can come back for two
14.2;Kartik to Tendulkar;1 run;120; pushes one to long-on for a single
14.3;Kartik to Pollard;no run;120; flat ball, Pollard looks to cut but it is too full
14.4;Kartik to Pollard;no run;120; gets the big front foot down and defends
14.5;Kartik to Pollard;1 run;121; teases Karthik, this is flighted, he stays back, and gets the bat down just when Karthik is thinking of an lbw appeal

15.1;Sharma to Tendulkar;1 run;123; gets this one right into the block hole, just a single to long-on
15.2;Sharma to Pollard;no run;123; gets the yorker right again, and Pollard hits it back to him
15.3;Sharma to Pollard;2 runs;125; nicely bowled, slower ball, not easy to pick, Pollard adjusts well, keeps the pull down, and finds a gap to be able to come back for two
15.4;Sharma to Pollard;FOUR;129; who says Pollard can't be delicate, he has guided this length delivery expertly between short third man and backward point
15.5;Sharma to Pollard;OUT;129; and Pollard has followed up a nice shot with a daft one, plays all across the line of a length delivery, Ishant is full and straight at the right time, and collects a plumb lbw verdict
15.6;Sharma to Sathish;no run;129; and Ishant bowls a bouncer right away, Sathish slam-ducks it, almost Sampras like, but two-handed - awkward shot, but he is safe as he has hit it into the ground
16.1;Kartik to Tendulkar;1 run;130; and he gets another leading edge out of Tendulkar who is bent at playing him to on, but again the edge is safe and he gets a single to point
16.2;Kartik to Sathish;1 run;131;
16.3;Kartik to Tendulkar;1 run;132; flat into the pads, easily worked away for one
16.4;Kartik to Sathish;FOUR;136; oh it's a tough shot made to look easy, makes room early, gives Karthik three stumps to aim at, and he bowls flat and Sathish meets it with an open face and places it between short third and backward point
16.5;Kartik to Sathish;2 runs;138; nice chip shot over extra cover, only looking to clear infield and does that
16.6;Kartik to Sathish;1 run;139; opens the face again, and gets just a single this time, but quick running from SRT
17.1;Bond to Sathish;FOUR;143; starts off with a slower ball, Sathish stays back and almost as if he is expecting it, he waits for it to arrive and lofts it over cover
17.2;Bond to Sathish;FOUR;147; and Sathish gets another boundary, not where he intended this one, though. Looks to whip it over leg, gets a leading edge over point and into the gap
17.3;Bond to Sathish;1 run;148; clears the front leg and pulls this one for one
17.4;Bond to Tendulkar;2 runs;150; slower ball, and steered to wide of third man for two
17.5;Bond to Tendulkar;1 run;151; dabbed to third man for one
17.6;Bond to Sathish;1 run;152; slapped to mid-on, comes though for one and makes it despite a direct-hit from Karthik
18.1;Mathews to Sathish;1 run;153; yorker, hit to sweeper-cover for one
18.2;Mathews to Tendulkar;1 run;154; full on the pads, hit straight to short fine
18.3;Mathews to Sathish;2 runs;156; and he has ended the match with his second vertical-bat pull, fine of fine leg this time

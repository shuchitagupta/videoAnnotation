<b>Sachin Tendulkar is winning captain, and is also the Man of The Match</b> Says he: "Shikhar batted really well, the first over set the tone. From the other end I started getting a few boundaries. We managed to put pressure on them early on, and later on it was a matter of staying there till the end. Bravo, McLaren, Zaheer, Malinga, Harbhajan, all bowled really well, and also the fielders."

<p class="commsText">
<b>Sourav Ganguly</b> "About 10 runs short, but I though it was fighting total. We don't bowl well upfront. [About his catches] Putting a bit of an effort on the field. This game requires it. [About the team] Hopefully we can turn it around from here."

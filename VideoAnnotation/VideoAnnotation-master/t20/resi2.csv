0.5;Bond to Dhawan, no run, tucks him up with a short delivery, played towards square leg		  
0.6;Bond to Dhawan, FOUR, another nice shot, there is not much room on the cut shot, but he hits it powerfully into the ground, and it then bounces over the ring of cover fielders		  
1.1;Sharma to Tendulkar, no run, wide outside off, Tendulkar shoulders arms		  
1.2;Sharma to Tendulkar, FOUR, what a shot! half-volley on middle stump, and he just meets it, and the on-drive goes flying across the outfield

1.6;Sharma to Tendulkar, FOUR, lovely shot again, this time he hits the drive well, opening the face on it, and placing it between mid-off and extra cover - all runs so far have cone in six boundaries

3.2;Sharma to Dhawan, 1 run, driven straight to Harpreet at cover and comes through for one		  
3.3;Sharma to Tendulkar, FOUR, bad bounce surely, Mathews is getting all of it! Punched off the back foot, two cover fielders, Karthik and Mathews have it covered, but it hits the edge of the practice wicket inside the circle, and spins away - going by the form Tendulkar has been over the last two years, he might even have intended it thus		  
3.4;Sharma to Tendulkar, FOUR, poor bowling, tries the bouncer, but there is no sting it, Tendulkar gets inside the line and pulls it over short fine

6.6;Kartik to Tiwary, no run, beats him with the turn first up, belts out an appeal, the ball is clearly turning too far down		  
7.1;Mathews to Tendulkar, no run, slower bouncer, Tendulkar lets it go, looks at both the umpires, doesn't get the wide call		  
7.2;Mathews to Tendulkar, FOUR, what a superb shot, slower bouncer again, and he waits for it and pulls, keeping it down, and places it perfectly between fine leg and deep square

11.4;Mathews to Tendulkar, 1 run, slower ball again, and dragged from off towards deep midwicket for a single		  
11.5;Mathews to Tiwary, SIX, he has agricultured this length ball down the ground for a six, gets it high on the bat but there is enough muscle behind it to carry it over long-on

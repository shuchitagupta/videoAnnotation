1;658;5;0;0.2;Malinga;Gayle;1 run; another yorker down the wrong line, flicked to fine leg for one
1;713;6;0;0.3;Malinga;Ganguly;1 bye; slower ball, Ganguly is comprehensively beaten, falls awkwardly in front of Tare, the keeper, they steal a bye
1;715;6;0;0.4;Malinga;Gayle;no run; slower offcutter, 131.3ks, Gayle is into the stab long before the ball arrives, beaten comprehensively
1;728;6;0;0.5;Malinga;Gayle;no run; another slower ball, this time Gayle is with it, and shoulders arms
1;819;10;0;0.6;Malinga;Gayle;4 byes; Tare should have done better than that! Another slower ball, really slow, 107ks, and Gayle is beaten again. By now Tare should have known what to expect and stayed low, but he didn't, and let go four byes
1;903;11;0;1.1;Khan;Ganguly;1 run; and nearly again! inside edge, almost through that gap, shaping in towards the off stick late, and somehow Dada gets an inside edge
1;904;11;0;1.2;Khan;Gayle;no run; on a length, around off, defended to cover
1;905;11;0;1.3;Khan;Gayle;no run; around that length around off again, played with an open face towards point
1;906;11;0;1.4;Khan;Gayle;no run; full and straight, around middle, Gayle defends, a big shot can't be away

1;908;11;0;1.6;Khan;Gayle;no run; end of a good over, no room again, and just short of that driving arc, played to cover
1;909;11;0;2.1;McLaren;Ganguly;no run; Ganguly looks to make room first ball and he follows him with a yorker outside leg, which passes between Ganguly and the stumps
1;1254;15;0;2.2;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; oh McLaren goes by what he must heard all this while, bowl short into Ganguly's ribs, and Ganguly somehow gets glove on that awkward pull shot
1;1299;19;0;2.3;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; much better, what a reply from Dada! moves across the stumps, takes a back-of-a-length delivery and whips it fine, beating long leg
1;1334;23;0;2.4;McLaren;Ganguly;FOUR; vintage Ganguly! McLaren's plan has been hit for a six! Bowls short and wide, and he has creamed him past point
1;1356;24;0;2.5;McLaren;Ganguly;1 wide; full and wide down the leg side
1;1357;24;0;2.5;McLaren;Ganguly;no run; plays with an open face, towards point, where Sathish and Pollard are almost an electric fence
1;1456;25;0;2.6;McLaren;Ganguly;1 bye; steps down the track, wafts and misses, and again the ball bounces in front of Tare, who gets his body behind it this time, hence the fumble results in just one bye

1;1546;29;0;3.2;Khan;Ganguly;FOUR; short, and sharp, and Ganguly pulls awkwardly, and somehow gets it over the infield, and the fast outfield does the rest
1;1547;29;0;3.3;Khan;Ganguly;no run; angling into him, looks to help it down to fine leg, misses it, but it is headed down the leg side
1;1548;29;0;3.4;Khan;Ganguly;no run; walks down the wicket and across the stumps, and misses the pick-up shot
1;1549;29;0;3.5;Khan;Ganguly;no run; beautiful legcutter from Zak, he has swallowed many a left-hander with it, Ganguly wafts at it outside off, and is beaten
1;1550;29;0;3.6;Khan;Ganguly;no run; and he is beaten again, steps out of the crease a touch too early, Zak bangs it in short and it beats his pull shot, moving away too after pitching
1;1551;29;0;4.1;Malinga;Gayle;no run; slower ball again, defended to cover
1;1552;29;0;4.2;Malinga;Gayle;no run; vicious offcutter, Gayle reaches out and stabs at it, the edge lands short of Pollard at backward point

1;1889;33;0;4.4;Malinga;Gayle;FOUR; falls short of Pollard at backward point, Gayle not having a good time of it out there, slower ball again and he reaches out again, just short of a diving Pollard and some how goes through him
1;1904;34;0;4.5;Malinga;Gayle;1 run; quicker delivery, quick yorker on the pads, gets down just in time, for a single
1;1905;34;0;4.6;Malinga;Ganguly;no run; quick bouncer, into the ribs, played back to Malinga

1;2066;35;0;5.2;Bravo;Gayle;1 wide; stays full, way down the leg side, and he lets out a big big appeal. Umpire Hazare not to be fooled
1;2067;35;0;5.2;Bravo;Gayle;no run; Bravo is perhaps the best fielder of his own bowling, Gayle misses a pick-up shot on the pads, Bravo is off to short midwicket in a flash to field and deny them a leg-bye

1;2187;37;0;5.3;Bravo;Gayle;1 run; slower ball, and he dives full length across the pitch but can't prevent a single to mid-off

1;2385;42;0;6.1;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; fires into the pads, worked away for one
1;2416;43;0;6.2;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;1 leg bye; and well bowled, flighted generously, outside leg, Dada steps out, is beaten by the dip, but gets his body behind it
1;2441;44;0;6.3;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; flatter delivery, and worked away for one
1;2442;44;0;6.4;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;no run; full and fast, yorker literally, dug out

1;2578;52;0;7.1;Bravo;Gayle;SIX; one of the flatter sixes, short and murdered, never really left the ground, and in a jiffy it was out of the playing field

1;2865;57;0;8.2;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;1 run; full and fast, driven down to long-off for a single
1;2866;57;0;8.3;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;no run; flighted outside leg, spinning towards the stumps, Gayle fails to connect on the sweep
1;2926;58;0;8.4;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; outside leg again, Gayle works it square of short fine for a single
1;2936;59;0;8.5;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;1 run; full and fast again, played with an open face, still only a single to sweeper-cover
1;2962;60;0;8.6;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; Gayle looks to give him the charge, Bhaj fires it into the pads again, just a single again

1;3213;63;0;9.3;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; full toss, and and murdered down the ground, Bravo does well to field it at long-on, he had moved only about six feet by the time ball arrived

1;3277;65;0;9.5;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; low full toss again, and hit down to long-off for one
1;3309;67;0;9.6;McLaren;Ganguly;2 runs; over-pitched delivery, driven wide of long-off, comes back for two
1;3384;68;0;10.1;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; full toss outside off, and still a single, mane full tosses hit for singles
1;3385;68;0;10.2;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;no run; shorter delivery, makes room, can't get it wide of point
1;3431;69;0;10.3;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;1 run; flighted around off, gets a single to cover
1;3454;70;0;10.4;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; tossed up, just short of driving length, punched down to long-off
1;3455;70;0;10.5;Harbhajan Singh;Ganguly;no run; sees Ganguly move away, he fires it full and wide across him

1;3583;71;1;11.1;McLaren;Gayle;1 wide; Gayle looks to make room, McLaren bowls a yorker, just outside leg, and is called a wide

1;3639;72;1;11.2;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; another full toss hit just for a single, down to long-on
1;3700;73;1;11.3;McLaren;Shah;1 run; looks in good touch right away, punched wide of sweeper-cover, but they decide against the second

1;3757;74;1;11.5;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; full toss again, and again all he can do with it is hit it to long-on
1;3758;74;1;11.6;McLaren;Shah;no run; very nice yorker, Shah digs it out, and almost gets it over McLaren who leaps high and gets a hand to it to save a single
1;3830;75;1;12.1;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; yorker by Bhaj, Gayle hits it down to long-off
1;3860;76;1;12.2;Harbhajan Singh;Shah;1 run; nice offbreak, no room, bunts it into covers for a single

1;3888;78;1;12.4;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;no run; another nice yorker, pitching on the crease, can't do much with that either
1;3933;79;1;12.5;Harbhajan Singh;Gayle;1 run; this yorker is around off, and he squeezes it past Bhaj for a single
1;3964;80;1;12.6;Harbhajan Singh;Shah;1 run; steps down, Bhaj fires a fast full toss, and again just a single to long-on. Good spell by Bhaj
1;4063;81;1;13.1;Bravo;Shah;1 run; low full toss and again just bunted down to long-on
1;4098;85;1;13.2;Bravo;Gayle;FOUR; nicely played, Gayle gets the better of the leg-side yorker this time, stays back, gets inside the line, and turns it past short fine leg - first boundary in 37 balls
1;4146;86;1;13.3;Bravo;Gayle;1 run; low full toss, gets under it, punches it, but it is just a single to deep midwicket
1;4180;88;1;13.4;Bravo;Shah;2 runs; slower ball, dragged from outside off to wide of long-on
1;4210;92;1;13.5;Bravo;Shah;FOUR; toe-ended into the V behind the stumps, wide yorker, Shah throws everything at it, and the edge beats short third - not smart bowling with the third man up in the circle
1;4246;93;1;13.6;Bravo;Shah;1 run; this yorker is closer to off, and is hit down to long-on for one
1;4312;94;1;14.1;Malinga;Shah;1 run; starts off with a bouncer, pulled away for a single to deep square leg

1;4526;102;1;14.6;Malinga;Shah;FOUR; that is a top shot, this is a good delivery and it's a boundary manufactured, stays deep in the crease, pre-meditating a yorker, and yorker it is, and moves across to flick it past midwicket
1;4615;106;1;15.1;Khan;Gayle;FOUR; one-handed pull for four, the short ball stops at him and he pulls one-handed, past short fine leg - his s/r reaches 100 - he has also reached his IPL best
1;4659;110;1;15.2;Khan;Gayle;FOUR; that's the first time he has taken full toll of a full toss, moves back to a low full toss and crashes it past short fine - that's his fifty too
1;4715;111;1;15.3;Khan;Gayle;1 leg bye; yorker on the pads, manages just a leg-bye
1;4717;111;1;15.4;Khan;Shah;no run; low full toss, and he misses out again! Hits it straight to midwicket

1;4831;118;1;15.6;Khan;Gayle;SIX; mis-hits it over long-on boundary, that's the power of Gayle! Gets this full toss high on his bat but goes through with the shot and clears the field
1;5060;119;1;16.1;Bravo;Shah;1 run; full toss again, he gets it over square leg for two - another full toss doesn't see the fence
1;5101;120;1;16.2;Bravo;Gayle;1 run; yorker on leg stump, hit straight to short fine, Bravo is not back to take the throw and Tendulkar's throw is far off the stumps - 50-run partnership
1;5139;121;1;16.3;Bravo;Shah;1 run; looks to hit across the line, slices it down to long-off
1;5173;123;1;16.4;Bravo;Gayle;2 runs; yorker outside leg stump again, this time they run urgently, and take a couple after having placed it just wide of fine leg
1;5241;124;1;16.5;Bravo;Gayle;1 leg bye; another full toss missed, makes no contact with the bat here, gets a leg-bye
1;5260;125;1;16.6;Bravo;Shah;1 run; full outside off, plays with an open face, gets a single, another over without a boundary
1;5328;126;1;17.1;McLaren;Shah;1 run; in the block hole again, hit down the ground for a single
1;5360;130;1;17.2;McLaren;Gayle;FOUR; inside edge for four! clears the front leg for the big shot, but the edge rushes past short fine
1;5425;134;1;17.3;McLaren;Gayle;FOUR; violence! misses the yorker by inches, and Gayle murders it. almost taking out the umpire with the straight hit
1;5439;136;1;17.4;McLaren;Gayle;2 runs; ends up chipping an intended extra-cover drive, gets two as it falls short of the deep fielder
1;5472;137;1;17.5;McLaren;Gayle;1 run; makes room for the cover drive, can't get it past extra cover
1;5522;139;1;17.6;McLaren;Shah;2 runs; yorker down the leg side, and Tare should have really collected this one, two runs given away
1;5609;140;1;18.1;Malinga;Gayle;1 run; slower ball, Gayle aborts the big shot, gets a single to point
1;5658;141;1;18.2;Malinga;Shah;1 run; moves across the stumps, stays deep in the crease, anticipating a yorker, Malinga bowls a slower ball, he flicks it to fine leg for one
1;5698;142;1;18.3;Malinga;Gayle;1 run; again a slower ball, and Gain Gayle gets just a single off it - to cover-point
1;5740;143;1;18.4;Malinga;Shah;1 run; slower ball, hit powerfully to leg, Dhawan makes a nice sliding save at deep square and gets it back fast
1;5773;144;1;18.5;Malinga;Gayle;1 wide; misdirects this slower offcutter, too wide of off stump
1;5816;147;1;18.5;Malinga;Gayle;3 runs; slower ball again, Gayle goes after it, and the top edge flies over short third man, and Zaheer - running back - misjudges it and they get three extra runs
1;5858;148;1;18.6;Malinga;Shah;1 run; full delivery, hit down the ground for one
1;5928;152;1;19.1;Khan;Shah;FOUR; nice shot, shuffles across, manufacture a leg-side line, and flicks a low full toss past short fine
1;5954;152;1;19.2;Khan;Shah;OUT; this time he makes room and gets outside the line, Zak bowls the same delivery and he misses it, and is bowled
1;5955;152;1;19.3;Khan;Mathews;no run; slower bouncer, beats Mathews comprehensively, and finally Tare keeps well despite the break away from him
1;6080;154;2;19.4;Khan;Mathews;2 runs; full toss again, and again he can't get it away, hits it just wide of long-on
1;6113;155;2;19.5;Khan;Mathews;1 run; perfect yorker, can get just a single off it
1;6114;155;2;19.6;Khan;Gayle;OUT; Has he broken the toe? What a lovely yorker, tailing in late, beats Gayle's bat, gets him on the back toe, Gayle is limping for a leg-bye. Umpire Hazare adds insult to injury, giving him lbw when the ball is sliding down. Hazare won't want this to go close - this one leg-bye could be crucial in the end
2;6952;4;0;0.1;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; too quick down the leg side, Dhawan gets a tickle fine
2;6953;4;0;0.2;Bond;Dhawan;no run; better line, around off, hit one bounce to cover
2;6969;4;0;0.3;Bond;Dhawan;no run; short, angling away, Babu [Dhawan] looks to cut, gets a bottom edge through to Saha
2;7051;8;0;0.4;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; lovely shot, poor bowling! full and wide, Dhawan gets across, on a knee, and elegantly extra-cover-drives it
2;7072;8;0;0.5;Bond;Dhawan;no run; tucks him up with a short delivery, played towards square leg
2;7121;12;0;0.6;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; another nice shot, there is not much room on the cut shot, but he hits it powerfully into the ground, and it then bounces over the ring of cover fielders
2;7155;12;0;1.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; wide outside off, Tendulkar shoulders arms
2;7235;16;0;1.2;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; what a shot! half-volley on middle stump, and he just meets it, and the on-drive goes flying across the outfield
2;7236;16;0;1.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; shorter outside off, and he lets it go through
2;7237;16;0;1.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; drives in front of his body, straight to mid-off
2;7359;20;0;1.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; what an outfield this is, he mis-hits a drive outside off, but it goes fast across the turf, beats mid-off and goes for four
2;7420;24;0;1.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; lovely shot again, this time he hits the drive well, opening the face on it, and placing it between mid-off and extra cover - all runs so far have cone in six boundaries
2;7454;24;0;2.1;Gayle;Dhawan;no run; short, around off, hit to point
2;7570;25;0;2.2;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; slightly back of  a length, punched down to long-off for a single
2;7641;26;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 wide; fired full and wide down the leg side, Tendulkar misses the vertical sweep, which would have got four
2;7656;27;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 wide; fired even further down the leg side
2;7673;28;0;2.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; flighted around off, pushed down to long-on
2;7696;29;0;2.4;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; short of a length, and punched down to long-off for a single
2;7722;31;0;2.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;2 runs; full ball, driven with an open face, Mathews at cover gets a bad bounce off a practice wicket and gives away an extra run
2;7723;31;0;2.6;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; what a save by Mathews, he has saved four here, was a crunchy extra-cover drive but Mathews dived to his right from cover - full-length - and doesn't even give away a single, so quick is he to get the ball back
2;7724;31;0;3.1;Sharma;Dhawan;no run; back of a length, no room, defended to cover
2;7868;32;0;3.2;Sharma;Dhawan;1 run; driven straight to Harpreet at cover and comes through for one
2;7912;36;0;3.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; bad bounce surely, Mathews is getting all of it! Punched off the back foot, two cover fielders, Karthik and Mathews have it covered, but it hits the edge of the practice wicket inside the circle, and spins away - going by the form Tendulkar has been over the last two years, he might even have intended it thus
2;7981;40;0;3.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; poor bowling, tries the bouncer, but there is no sting it, Tendulkar gets inside the line and pulls it over short fine
2;8002;44;0;3.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; Ishant is being taken to school here, bowls another bouncer at Tendulkar - at his pace, seriously? - and Tendulkar pulls it over midwicket, what a crunchy shot
2;8069;45;0;3.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 wide; slower ball, wide down the leg side
2;8070;45;0;3.6;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; hit to point, and Tendulkar decides against the single, both originally and also off the overthrow
2;8172;46;0;4.1;Gayle;Dhawan;1 run; swept from way outside off, gets a single to deep midwicket
2;8249;50;0;4.2;Gayle;Tendulkar;FOUR; whipped away from the middle stump, all along the ground, and between midwicket and square leg - and it's a small gap, picked to perfection - fifty up in 4.2
2;8250;50;0;4.3;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; and again, this time he finds midwicket, though
2;8252;50;0;4.4;Gayle;Tendulkar;no run; makes room for the cut, but gets a bottom edge on the shot
2;8301;51;0;4.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; full, driven down to long-on for a single
2;8302;51;0;4.6;Gayle;Dhawan;no run; punched to extra-cover, no run
2;8438;52;0;5.1;Bond;Tendulkar;1 run; starts off with a slower ball, around off, takes a single to cover

2;8440;52;0;5.3;Bond;Dhawan;no run; full ball, pushed to point
2;8441;52;0;5.4;Bond;Dhawan;no run; nice crunchy cover-drive, can't beat extra cover
2;8610;56;0;5.5;Bond;Dhawan;FOUR; poor short delivery, 125ks, sitting up and asking to be hit, and Dhawan sends it packing to deep midwicket
2;8624;57;0;5.6;Bond;Dhawan;1 run; this is the quicker short delivery, which means the pull shot travels much squarer, and he gets a single
2;8721;58;0;6.1;Kartik;Dhawan;1 run; spinning into the pads, turned around the corner for a single
2;8765;59;0;6.2;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; works the ball into the leg side, from in front of off, and gets a single
2;8798;60;0;6.3;Kartik;Dhawan;1 run; flat into the pads, helped away for one
2;8825;61;0;6.4;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; again worked away from in front of the stumps, gets a single to fine leg
2;8826;61;0;6.5;Kartik;Dhawan;OUT; that's a wicket against the run of the play, Dhawan jumps down the track, looking to chip him over short midwicket, but doesn't get enough elevation and Ganguly takes a sharp overhead catch
2;8827;61;0;6.6;Kartik;Tiwary;no run; beats him with the turn first up, belts out an appeal, the ball is clearly turning too far down
2;8828;61;0;7.1;Mathews;Tendulkar;no run; slower bouncer, Tendulkar lets it go, looks at both the umpires, doesn't get the wide call
2;9091;65;1;7.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;FOUR; what a superb shot, slower bouncer again, and he waits for it and pulls, keeping it down, and places it perfectly between fine leg and deep square
2;9105;66;1;7.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 wide; and he follows it with a quicker delivery angling down the leg side
2;9140;67;1;7.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; flicked away from in front of stumps, gets a single to fine leg
2;9169;67;1;7.4;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; punched with an open face, can't beat point
2;9170;67;1;7.5;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; back of a length, no room there, hit back to the bowler
2;9245;69;1;7.6;Mathews;Tiwary;2 runs; short and wide, and crashed away wide of sweeper-cover for two
2;9306;70;1;8.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; worked away from off stump line, into the leg side for a single
2;9307;70;1;8.2;Kartik;Tiwary;no run; nice forward-defensive outside off
2;9378;71;1;8.3;Kartik;Tiwary;1 run; full into the pads, driven down to long-on for one
2;9379;71;1;8.4;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; slows this down, bowls way outside off so Sachin can flick him to leg, gets a defensive shot out of him
2;9380;71;1;8.5;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; and smartly bowled again, flatter outside off, and gets a leading-edge from him, but doesn't pick the ball at all, and doesn't accept the return catch
2;9381;71;1;8.6;Kartik;Tendulkar;no run; flighted outside off again, and driven straight to point
2;9391;71;1;9.1;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; slower ball, around leg, and breaking away, hit back to the bowler
2;9675;72;1;9.2;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; slower again, punched down to long-on for one
2;9719;73;1;9.3;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; pushes a length ball down to long-on for a single
2;9770;75;1;9.4;Mathews;Tiwary;2 runs; Tiwary muscles a short slow ball down the ground, Karthik from long-on has to put in the dive to save two runs
2;9771;75;1;9.5;Mathews;Tiwary;no run; makes room and hits a length ball back to Mathews, who does well to get a hand to it
2;9845;76;1;9.6;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; full ball across him, nearly a yorker, gets enough on it to take a quick single
2;9915;77;1;10.1;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; flat delivery, hit down to long-off for a single
2;9948;78;1;10.2;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; into the pads, worked away for one to deep square leg
2;9971;79;1;10.3;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; flat, angled into him, punched wide of long-off
2;10000;80;1;10.4;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; steps down, drives inside out, can't get it wide enough of long-off for a two
2;10016;80;1;10.5;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; makes room, Gayle follows him, can't get the drive past extra cover
2;10017;80;1;10.6;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; steps down, yorks himself, another tight over for KKR
2;10116;82;1;11.1;Mathews;Tendulkar;2 runs; full ball, placed nicely to the left of long-off, and comes back for two
2;10155;83;1;11.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; and he looks to slog, a slower delivery it is, and bounces in front of Ganguly at midwicket, who misfields and lets through a single
2;10206;84;1;11.3;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; nice bouncer, gets high on him, but Tiwary stands tall and manages to keep the pull shot down
2;10253;85;1;11.4;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; slower ball again, and dragged from off towards deep midwicket for a single
2;10295;91;1;11.5;Mathews;Tiwary;SIX; he has agricultured this length ball down the ground for a six, gets it high on the bat but there is enough muscle behind it to carry it over long-on
2;10384;92;1;11.6;Mathews;Tiwary;1 run; walks down the track and guides a full delivery past cover for one
2;10455;96;1;12.1;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; good placement there, Gayle bowls a fast full toss, and he drives it past extra cover - KKR never used their full tosses, remember?
2;10456;96;1;12.2;Gayle;Tiwary;no run; full outside leg, hits it straight to midwicket
2;10494;100;1;12.3;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; another full toss and hit down the ground, Mandeep from long-off makes a despairing dive for the catch but it's too far and too fast
2;10528;101;1;12.4;Gayle;Tiwary;1 run; full ball hit to long-off for one
2;10590;102;1;12.5;Gayle;Tendulkar;1 run; worked off the hips for a single to square leg
2;10619;106;1;12.6;Gayle;Tiwary;FOUR; and Tiwary is at it again, length ball, and he muscles it down the ground, and damn straight, four more, we are headed towards a quick finish
2;10723;110;1;13.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; Nothing has changed here son! When he was taken off the attack, Tendulkar was hitting Ishant for fours. He comes back, bowls first ball on a length, and Tendulkar lofts him over midwicket
2;10783;114;1;13.2;Sharma;Tendulkar;FOUR; length again, and he has been smashed past midwicket again! Tough love from the senior man of his international side
2;10811;116;1;13.3;Sharma;Tendulkar;2 runs; gets the yorker in, and he gets into the gap on the on side and keeps the strike again
2;10812;116;1;13.4;Sharma;Tendulkar;no run; slower legcutter, Tendulkar looks to guide it past the keeper but is beaten
2;10908;117;1;13.5;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 run; full ball outside off, and he flicks it to on, he is just toying with Ishant
2;10909;117;1;13.6;Sharma;Tiwary;OUT; Ganguly takes a second good catch off the night! Tiwary is looking extra cover but it is too short for the shot, and he ends up seemingly lobbing it over Dada at short extra, but he times the jump to perfection and pulls off a one-handed stunner
2;11082;119;2;14.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;2 runs; flighted outside off, looks to play to on, gets a leading edge but it travels so slowly to long-on that he can come back for two
2;11109;120;2;14.2;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; pushes one to long-on for a single
2;11110;120;2;14.3;Kartik;Pollard;no run; flat ball, Pollard looks to cut but it is too full
2;11111;120;2;14.4;Kartik;Pollard;no run; gets the big front foot down and defends
2;11182;121;2;14.5;Kartik;Pollard;1 run; teases Karthik, this is flighted, he stays back, and gets the bat down just when Karthik is thinking of an lbw appeal
2;11210;122;2;14.6;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; flat delivery on off, worked away for one to long-on
2;11288;123;2;15.1;Sharma;Tendulkar;1 run; gets this one right into the block hole, just a single to long-on
2;11291;123;2;15.2;Sharma;Pollard;no run; gets the yorker right again, and Pollard hits it back to him
2;11394;125;2;15.3;Sharma;Pollard;2 runs; nicely bowled, slower ball, not easy to pick, Pollard adjusts well, keeps the pull down, and finds a gap to be able to come back for two
2;11435;129;2;15.4;Sharma;Pollard;FOUR; who says Pollard can't be delicate, he has guided this length delivery expertly between short third man and backward point
2;11436;129;2;15.5;Sharma;Pollard;OUT; and Pollard has followed up a nice shot with a daft one, plays all across the line of a length delivery, Ishant is full and straight at the right time, and collects a plumb lbw verdict
2;11457;129;2;15.6;Sharma;Sathish;no run; and Ishant bowls a bouncer right away, Sathish slam-ducks it, almost Sampras like, but two-handed - awkward shot, but he is safe as he has hit it into the ground
2;11763;130;3;16.1;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; and he gets another leading edge out of Tendulkar who is bent at playing him to on, but again the edge is safe and he gets a single to point
2;11800;131;3;16.2;Kartik;Sathish;1 run;
2;11812;132;3;16.3;Kartik;Tendulkar;1 run; flat into the pads, easily worked away for one
2;11828;136;3;16.4;Kartik;Sathish;FOUR; oh it's a tough shot made to look easy, makes room early, gives Karthik three stumps to aim at, and he bowls flat and Sathish meets it with an open face and places it between short third and backward point
2;11864;138;3;16.5;Kartik;Sathish;2 runs; nice chip shot over extra cover, only looking to clear infield and does that
2;11884;139;3;16.6;Kartik;Sathish;1 run; opens the face again, and gets just a single this time, but quick running from SRT
2;11970;143;3;17.1;Bond;Sathish;FOUR; starts off with a slower ball, Sathish stays back and almost as if he is expecting it, he waits for it to arrive and lofts it over cover
2;12023;147;3;17.2;Bond;Sathish;FOUR; and Sathish gets another boundary, not where he intended this one, though. Looks to whip it over leg, gets a leading edge over point and into the gap
2;12043;148;3;17.3;Bond;Sathish;1 run; clears the front leg and pulls this one for one
2;12076;150;3;17.4;Bond;Tendulkar;2 runs; slower ball, and steered to wide of third man for two
2;12110;151;3;17.5;Bond;Tendulkar;1 run; dabbed to third man for one
2;12150;152;3;17.6;Bond;Sathish;1 run; slapped to mid-on, comes though for one and makes it despite a direct-hit from Karthik
2;12271;153;3;18.1;Mathews;Sathish;1 run; yorker, hit to sweeper-cover for one
2;12319;154;3;18.2;Mathews;Tendulkar;1 run; full on the pads, hit straight to short fine
2;12364;156;3;18.3;Mathews;Sathish;2 runs; and he has ended the match with his second vertical-bat pull, fine of fine leg this time
